# My pokedex
A web app with a pokedex made with vanilla javascript as a starter project. Using the `pokeAPI`, 
I request to their servers all the data from the pokemons and fetch all the types, stats and 
other resources. Also I use the `localStorage API` to store the current visualized pokemon info.
